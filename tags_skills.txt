tagSkillDevotion=Devotion

tagSkillClassDescription01=Soldiers of the imperial army were trained to survive in the{^n}most hellish conditions and hold the line against the deadliest{^n}enemies of the empire. Soldiers prefer the use of close combat{^n}weaponry, such as a sword and shield, but can also prove{^n}formidable with firearms. What a Soldier may lack in outright{^n}damage output is made up for in fortitude and leadership.

tagSkillClassDescription02=Pyrotechnic masters of the imperial army, Demolitionists are{^n}part engineer and part sorcerer. They were used to break enemy{^n}ranks and breach fortifications with their devastating array{^n}of explosives and destructive magic. They usually prefer to{^n}fight at range; engaging enemies with guns, traps and explosives{^n}but they can also be proficient with melee weapons.

tagSkillClassDescription03=Once hunted by imperial forces in an effort to control eldritch{^n}power, the Occultist's craft focuses heavily on summoning and{^n}borrowed powers granted by the three witch "gods" Bysmiel,{^n}Solael and Dreeg. Their diverse arts include abhorrent curses{^n}and spells that inflict damage with poison, acid, and entropic{^n}energy. Excelling with neither sword nor gun, they can use{^n}either to augment their offense.

tagSkillClassDescription04=Nightblades were clandestine warriors that sold their services to the great houses of the empire. Nightblades excel with all{^n}manner of martial weapons, but are even more feared for the deadly blade magic that is the secret of their trade. Nightblades are not suited to go toe to toe with tougher enemies and rely on illusion to close for quick, devastating attacks or fight from a distance with phantasmal blades.

tagSkillClassDescription05=To Arcanists, the manifestation of magic is not some unexplainable mystery or the will of the gods, but a science meant to be unraveled.  This pursuit of knowledge drives all Arcanists, always eager to discover a new technique to make their namesake.  Arcanists warp Aetherial and elemental{^n}energy to their will, creating devastating demonstrations of power that rival small armies.  However, such raw force leaves little in terms of defense.

tagSkillClassDescription06=Hailing from the untamed northlands, Shamans were the{^n}spiritual leaders and guardians of their people. Claiming an astounding attunement to the wilds and their patron deity Mogdrogen, Shamans are capable of wielding the terrible forces of nature against their foes or even calling upon savage beasts to come to their aid. Shamans excel in the use of brutal two-handed melee weapons, but can easily adapt to other tools of war when conjuring their primal powers.
