tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 1st Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01Text=I am currently en route to the village of Burrwitch in order to investigate a number of strange incidents that have been reported in this area. As dusk is drawing near and the swamps of this region are said to be hazardous to travel at night, I've reluctantly taken up lodging at a small squalid tavern in Lower Crossing.{^n}{^n}Perhaps I am weary from my hurried travels but I feel as if there is a strange pressure and electricity to the air. It is almost akin to the still before a thunderous summer gale but yet the sun shines and not a cloud is to be seen.  Everything seems as it should, but in my gut I feel that something terrible will soon come to pass...

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 2nd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 2nd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02Text=As I was packing to resume my journey to Burrwitch, my assistance was urgently requested at a logging camp in the Old Grove west of Devil's Crossing, where strange animal attacks have left three lumbermen listless and pale.{^n}{^n}Upon arriving, I received a somber greeting from the foreman who informed me that the bitten workers had gone mad and fled the premises. They were reported to have spoken in an unknown tongue.  The foreman showed me the remains of the animals. Two gray foxes and a hound, suffering some sort of horrific mange, lay in a hastily dug pit behind the outhouse. The foreman told me the animals suddenly died when confronted by the workers and a strange green vapor emanated from their remains. Shortly afterwards, the three lumbermen fell ill and their mental state rapidly deteriorated. It appears that my presence in this region is most warranted.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 3rd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 3rd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03Text=I've finally arrived in Burrwitch after passing through the dismal area known as Wightmire. For years, tales of supernatural occurrences have circulated about Wightmire and indeed the name itself makes one uneasy. I hadn't put much stock in them but my recent experiences lend some credence to the old tales.{^n}{^n}Nevertheless, I have reached my destination and it seems the Warden of Devil's Crossing, who resides in Burrwitch, somehow anticipated my arrival. A footman greeted me as soon as I entered town and insisted I accept Krieg's invitation to be put up at his manor. I find this very peculiar but I have accepted the offer as it may be my best chance to investigate the manor itself.{^n}{^n}Going to make this entry short as I've just been summoned to join Krieg for supper in the dining hall. This should prove...  illuminating.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 4th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 4th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04Text=I've been a guest to Warden Krieg at his manor for over a week now and my suspicions that something terrible is going on here grow with each day. Every day, I set out to some destination in or around Burrwitch to investigate yet another unusual crime or ominous rumor. Some are easily dismissed as more mundane human crimes or merely fantastic tales, but many of my investigations have come to darker conclusions. I feel there is a pattern emerging here but I cannot yet put the pieces together.{^n}{^n}These are peripheral cases though and the main purpose of my involvement in them is to give pretense for my prolonged stay in Burrwitch. Krieg himself has become the focus of my primary investigation. Despite an overwhelming conviction that Krieg is not what he appears to be and is almost certainly involved in some sort of unnatural activity, I have found no irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing that could be used to open an official inquisition.{^n}{^n}Much of the manor itself is closed off to me. There are rooms upstairs from which Krieg and other visitors come and go but I am not permitted to enter. Stranger yet, I've awoken in the night to sounds like the creaking of wagons moving along a road but then looked out my window down upon the village and seen nothing. Where are these sounds coming from? The game of cat and mouse continues but, as of yet, I am not certain who is the cat and who is the mouse...

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 5th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 5th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05Text=Krieg has gotten the better of me and I am presently at his mercy, imprisoned beneath his manor.{^n}{^n}Seeing no other way to progress in my investigation, I forced my way into the locked portion of the manor and found myself in a veritable house of horrors. The unusual sorcery on the locks should have been my first clue that I was dealing with something more extraordinary than some rogue occultist.{^n}{^n}My search led me through a room filled with the rotting bodies of men and women subjected to brutal torture or horrible experimentation, or perhaps some mix of the two. Behind the manor I found a door leading down into the earth beneath the estate, where I found myself quickly lost in an implausibly large dungeon. It wasn't long before I sensed things moving in the darkness all around me and they quickly closed in, surrounding me. As I prepared to fight for all I was worth, Krieg's massive form emerged from the shadows, his face expressionless. He spoke coolly as though nothing at all was out of the ordinary and invited me to tour his facility. While I had no doubt that something unpleasant was planned for me, it at least delayed my confrontation with the living horrors gathering in the dark.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 6th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 6th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06Text=I've lingered in this dank cell for one long unsettling day and a night of terrors. Krieg allowed me to witness the process by which they are preserving human bodies for what he calls the Glorious Dawn.{^n}{^n}I have gotten glimmerings of another consciousness within Krieg, which is joined with or possibly in control of him. From the way he spoke, it is clear that this is only some small part of a much greater conspiracy and I suspect many other persons in key positions have been possessed by things akin to that which now inhabits Krieg. I was arrogant in my initial handling of Krieg and seriously misjudged the power and scale of the threat we are faced with.{^n}{^n}Fortunately, Krieg's own arrogance has likewise led him to misjudge the resourcefulness of his prisoner. He has invited me to ascend beyond humanity by pledging myself to his cause or to join his inventory of embalmed corpses. I've been left to contemplate this decision but this cell, even magically warded, cannot hold the likes of me and I have no intention of being here when Krieg returns for my answer.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 7th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 7th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07Text=Much time has passed since my last entry. Following my escape from Krieg's laboratory, I have raced against time and lost, passed through darkness and flame, and witnessed the ruin of the world as I knew it.{^n}{^n}Even as I assumed key figures in the capital were likely to be possessed by the entities we now call Aetherials, I reasoned that it was only with support from within capital that we could hope to thwart them. Any action that began outside the capital could be spun as a political rebellion and crushed with the empire's own forces before the truth could be exposed. Thus, I cast the dice and raced toward the heart of Erulan, trying to conceal myself as best I could.{^n}{^n}Upon my arrival, I proceeded cautiously, booking a room at a squalid inn near the west gates in an effort to keep my arrival secret. Initially I sought out old acquaintances, assuming if I could detect some change in personality or behavior, it might reveal possession. A few awkward reunions made it painfully obvious that years on the road carrying out my duties as an inquisitor had left me out of touch and unable to discern whether any changes were the result of possession, or just the passage of time and faded memories. The only gamble left then was to report back to the citadel of the Luminari and see what came of it. I never made it there.{^n}{^n}Waiting until the sunlight dwindled and crowds thinned in the streets below, I rose to leave but was quite startled to see that a shadowy figure had somehow silently breached my room, evading all of the wards set against intruders. This is how I came into cooperation with the First Blade.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 8th Entry 
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 8th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Text=It was known that anyone of significance who fomented discontent or posed a real threat to the rule of the emperor might be visited by the First Blade. I had never stirred such controversy but I always imagined, if such an encounter took place, I could put up a respectable fight. I never got the chance. Taken unawares, I was disarmed before I even knew what was happening. Had he sought my death, I would not have even witnessed the killing stroke fall. However, he seemed more interested in answers instead and, in turn, provided me with an account of his own events that confirmed my worst fears.{^n}{^n}The First Blade revealed that, only days prior, he had been forced to turn his knives on the Emperor himself, by his own command. Despite the myriad safeguards protecting the Emperor, both mundane and arcane, he had become host to an Aetherial. Through strength of mind, he had usurped his possessor long enough to summon the First Blade, command his own execution and charge the assassin with ensuring that his son, the young prince, survive to reclaim the throne.{^n}{^n}His last commands issued, the Emperor's consciousness slipped once again under the control of the Aetherial and a desperate battle ensued. The First Blade reported that he believed the Emperor and the Aetherial within him slain but, given his inexperience with the entities, could not say anything for certain. He relayed that he had secretly taken the prince and put him into hiding but declined to elaborate. The First Blade said he intended to retire his imperial title and had chosen the name Ulgrim, which made me curious as to whether it was an intentional reference to the mythic character.{^n}{^n}A final troubling detail was that no proclamation of the Emperor's passing had been issued. Not only did this demonstrate the Aetherials had sufficient control of the palace to conceal the death but, given that they couldn't hope to hide the Emperor's absence for long, it suggested the next phase of their operation was imminent.{^n}{^n}I strategized with Ulgrim long into the night, formulating a plan to counter the Aetherials, but ultimately we agreed that we could not defeat their conspiracy in time. The only course left was gather whatever people and resources we could, go to ground and weather the coming storm; then find a way to counter the invaders.{^n}{^n}We agreed that the Black Legion would be our best hope in securing allies. As a conscripted army of criminals, debtors and political dissidents bound to service, it seemed unlikely that the Aetherials would have any reason to infiltrate them when they could control them indirectly through the military high command. The next step was to discretely make contact.


tagLoreObject_PrisonNoteName=Crudely Scrawled Note
tagLoreObject_PrisonNoteText=Now, I ain't a decent man and I sure ain't good at writing, but word needs to get out 'bout what this place really is. This prison, it ain't like no joint I ever been in, and I've seen double my share. Men don't stay here long neither and some of the lads they haul in, they ain't criminals. I'd know. Moment I see a man, I can tell by his eyes that he done wrong. These boys? I see fear.{^n}{^n}I seen this warden a coupla times, big man in black armor. If you ain't know better, you'd think he was on the wrong side of the bars. Every day, he and his lackeys take prisoners out to this hut in the yard by the dozen. They ain't never come out. Later, a wagon rolls in by the hut. It always leaves full.{^n}{^n}They don't let us outa our cells no more, but I can tell there ain't much of us left. The halls are quiet. I'm the last man in my row. The others? They was taken in yesterday's batch. I ain't asking for pity. I know my end's in that hut; but perhaps this note will be my one good deed in my pathetic life...


tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01Name=Harbormaster's Log - Lower Crossing
tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01codexTitle=Harbormaster's Log
tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01Text=Autumn fogs are appearing early this year but traffic remains unusually high.  There is a steady flow of small craft coming down from Malmouth and other townships to the Nor'East. Some of these boats are barely afloat burdened with what looks like people's every possession. These travelers, sometimes entire families, bring with them strange tales of wars and the unnatural. Bunch'a hogwash riling up the soft townsfolk. Can't complain tho', keeps the dock busy. Most are Westbound, trying to get as far away as they can.{^n}{^n}The lads at the docks are starting to lose their nerve. Some have talked about setting out West themselves but I've assured them this is all nonsense and will pass. Youth are easily caught up in the energy of the moment.

tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01Name=Harbormaster's Log - Burrwitch
tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01codexTitle=Harbormaster's Log
tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01Text=Another boat arrived filled with hooded prisoners, dozens of 'em. As usual, a wagon was waiting for them but from what I hear, it doesn't take 'em far. One of the loading boys came back from Burrwitch after visiting that there new doctor and he said the wagon stopped outside the Warden's mansion. The lad asked 'bout the prisoners and one of the handlers said "rehabilitation". Not sure what to make of that.{^n}{^n}There's been o'er a dozen of these prisoner transports in as many weeks. I just don't see how they can fit 'em all in that mansion. I don't care how big that place may be, Krieg won't be keeping a prison's worth of no good thieves under his roof. Somethin' peculiar is going on there and it don't settle right in my stomach. Might have to send word up the lake to Malmouth, get one of them inquisitors down here to look into this curiosity. Can't say I want one o'them inquisitors poking around here much either though. They make a man uneasy.

tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA02Text=I'm trapped here...I realize now, I will die in this house.  Margaret, I fear that you are already dead and so it may not be so bad if I am shortly to join you.  If by some miracle, you yet live and return here to find this note, please know that I am not angry with you. I've never regretted our life together but now only regret that I lost my temper and spoke unkind words when last we parted.{^n}{^n}I hope you will not think me a coward for what I am about to do. They are already in the house. I've barricaded myself in this room but it is only a matter of time before they break through.  All I can do now is choose the manner in which I face death and I would rather die a man than be changed into one of those horrid things or eaten alive.  I will love you always...{^n}{^n}Francis

tagLoreObj_WightmireA01Name=Missive to Wightmire Bloodbound
tagLoreObj_WightmireA01codexTitle=Bloodbound Missive
tagLoreObj_WightmireA01Text=The time has come to strike at our Aetherial nemesis in Wightmire. Even now, we gather our forces in the hills above Burrwitch for an assault on the Village. However, before that can happen, we must first secure Wightmire so that there are no enemies at our backs.{^n}{^n}Though strong, loyal and ready to die in the name of Ch'thon, I believe you have insufficient Bloodbound to overcome the Aetherial presence. We have had great success recently in bringing forth more powerful servants of Ch'thon from the Void. A single Harbinger could wipe out all of the Aetherians in Wightmire and even take on Devil's Crossing, which could serve as a stronghold for our order in this region.{^n}{^n}To bring forth a Harbinger, you will need the blood and lives of at least three men. Gather the sacrifices however you see fit; either from refugees on the road, rover camps or chosen amongst your own Bloodbound. Inform me of your success when it is complete.{^n}{^n}Ulto Treig, Grand Priest

tagLoreObj_WightmireA02Name=Milton Hart's Note
tagLoreObj_WightmireA02Text=I'm afraid I may have to break a promise. I'm not about to give up yet but things aren't looking good outside. I was lucky to survive that first night when I volunteered to distract the rotten walkers while Bourbon and his group, including my little sister Sybil, made their way through to Devil's Crossing. I believe in Bourbon and if anyone can get those people through, it's him. Before they left, I looked Bourbon in the eye and told him to keep her safe. He put his arm on my shoulder and spoke in that calm reassuring tone of his. He told me that he would do everything he can, but I had to promise him something too: that I would do my damn best to get out of this alive.{^n}{^n}Well I've sure got myself into a fine fix. I diverted them walkers alright but now I'm all hemmed in. I've been hiding in a group of old dilapidated shacks and keep changing position whenever the dead get too close. I can't find a way forward though and I'm running out of daylight. The walkers seem stupid generally but I think they dug out the riverbanks last night, allowing the water to wash the road out. It's almost as though something is directing them.{^n}{^n}I'm not done yet and have no intention of dying in this rotting shack. I'm going to try to break free and will go out fighting if I have to. If the worst comes to pass and you're finding this note on my cold corpse, well, please let my sister Sybil know what's come to pass and tell her to be brave. I can only hope she made it to Devil's Crossing.

tagLoreObj_WightmireA03Name=Dirt-Covered Note
tagLoreObj_WightmireA03Text=Got ourselves a bunch of them idiot Rovers wandering in our hideout the other night. They were unarmed, as they often are. Course, they tried to run when we jumped them, but little good that did them. Now we have ourselves a few slaves digging in the mine. We can't eat coal though, and our food supplies are starting to run out. The Rovers barely had a few scraps between them.{^n}{^n}With the Burrwitch bridge destroyed, we're stuck in this swamp. I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we made a mistake by not following Cronley's Gang to the west. May not be much pickings in the wilderness on that side of Devil's Crossing, but at least they had numbers. Could probably hunt down a decent-sized boar between the lot of them. Out here? We got nothing but slith and the dead. 



tagLoreObj_WardensJournalA01Name=Warden Krieg's Journal
tagLoreObj_WardensJournalA01Text=I have taken possession of my assigned vessel, the local prison warden. I appeared to him in his bed chamber and proposed the joining. I had anticipated fear and skepticism but these humans are apparently all too ready to enter into any pact they believe will profit them. Krieg is not a particularly strong willed human but he is persistent and constantly scratches at my consciousness. I have him under control though.{^n}{^n}Krieg's position as an incarcerator of other humans will greatly facilitate our efforts. His expansive dwelling has a massive cellar that I believe we can use to fashion an underground transit to conceal our activities and the transport of bodies. There is much work ahead to prepare for our Glorious Dawn but I rather enjoy this physical body. It has many advantages.

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA01Name=Gethrand's Notes - 1st Entry
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA01Text=It is unclear why the Aetherials are so interested in tissue preservation. One of my colleagues has posited that they may intend to use human corpses as vessels for possession when they bring more of their kind into our realm.{^n}{^n}Wagon loads of corpses continue to stream in day and night. The sheer quantity is staggering and I begin to suspect that they are not merely executed criminals as we've been told.

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA02Name=Gethrand's Notes - 2nd Entry
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA02Text=We entered stage two of our trials today but the results were not what I had anticipated.  We've progressed to the point where the corpses can endure for months, possibly years, with minimal, mostly external, deterioration. Our Aetherial overseer seemed satisfied and he, or it, unexpectedly placed his hand upon one of the corpses and released a spark of aetherial energy. The thing began to move as if it were alive again. It was a ghastly sight.{^n}{^n}What I found far more troubling though is that these corpses are clearly not meant to serve as Aetherial hosts. It has become known to me that they prefer living hosts. The sheer number of corpses they are hauling through here suggests a far worse realization: an army.

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA03Name=Gethrand's Notes - Final Entry
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA03Text=This will be my last entry as I have determined to end my life. I cannot bring myself to carry out these abominable experiments any longer. I may have already doomed humanity with my actions. Though I have long felt shunned by my fellows at the academy and thought the Aetherials could offer me something greater, I can no longer be a part of this. I fear that if they find my body, they will use me for their experimentations, so I must be discreet. Returning as one of those...things would be unbearable.

tagLoreObj_WardensLabB01Name=Zanbrandt's Notes
tagLoreObj_WardensLabB01Text=My colleague Gethrand took his life today - that shortsighted fool. He could never see the big picture and this project was no different. Gethrand could not fathom the glorious vision of the Aetherials and the role we will play as early human collaborators. This isn't about personal gain. We will elevate humanity! Certainly there has been a cost in lives but progress always has a price. So what of the dirty masses who will perish in the Glorious Dawn when the Aetherials reveal themselves to the world. To the Aetherials we are like some base primitive creature, as the Slith are to us. Those of us who will serve, or better yet, bond with an Aetherial, shall forge a new human future.

In all future material correspondence we will use our host names and common human language forms.{^n}{^n}I write looking for clarification of recent perplexing reports on your conduct.  Is it true that you have been incarcerating and tormenting humans?  What is the purpose for this?  It would seem that your host's predilections are affecting your own behavior. You must bring this under your control and cease this superfluous activity.  Your role is to facilitate our laboratories with the collection of corpses. Limit yourself to the parameters of this task or you will be recalled.

tagLoreObj_VillagerNoteB01Text=1st entry{^n}Momma told me to write in this thing, so I suppose now is as good as ever, seeing as I'm grounded, again! So I pulled Abigail's hair. She started it! Why doesn't she have to sit in her room and write in her stupid diary?{^n}{^n}Tomorrow, I'll catch the biggest frog I can find in the marshes and leave it in sister's room. We'll see how she likes that.{^n}{^n}2nd entry{^n}So Momma's been reading my diary and now I'm grounded again. The frog got out before sister even saw it! Why isn't Poppa home yet?

Perkins said that there are monsters roaming the marshes, but Momma said there is no such thing and she whooped me with the ladle for talking rumors again. I wish Poppa would come home already. I want to go to Burrwitch!{^n}{^n}Alister's Diary - 4th entry{^n}I'm scared. I'm really really scared. Momma locked me and sister in my room while she checked out some noises behind the house. It's been forever and now I hear noises inside the house too. Poppa, please come home and make the noises go away. I don't care about Burrwitch anymore. Just please come home, Poppa.

TagLoreObj_VillagerNoteH01Text=Town is falling apart around me. Those things are everywhere. God knows what's making them rise. Half of Burrwitch is in flames and still they continue to multiply. No sense trying to stick this out so I'm packing some basics and leaving immediately. I hear the north is all but overrun so I'll try my luck in the south, through Wightmire.{^n}{^n}Horace, if you are reading this note, I'll make camp at Devil's Crossing. Last place I'd want to end up on a good day, but the prison sounds safer than being out in the wild with those things about. Meet me there, if you're still alive.

TagLoreObj_VillagerNoteJ01Text=Third bunch of bandits this month. You would think that with all that's happened recently people would be a bit more willing to help out one another. But no, seems the world is still teeming with scum who would take advantage of a bad situation.{^n}{^n}If you are a friend of these dirt-bags, follow me and die. There is still room on my belt for a few more notches. If perhaps you are just another lost soul wandering these ruins, don't look for friends out here. People out here are just as likely to slit your throat for a few bullets as to point you in a safe direction. I'm not going to hesitate to fire the first shot, and neither should you.

I hear only deathly silence!{^n}{^n}Doom has befallen the wicked, the ignorant and the indolent.

Take strength in each other and in the knowledge that we are destined to fulfill this divine purpose.{^n}{^n}Long have we prepared for this moment and our time of concealment is ending. We will strike forth, boldly Northward and to our destiny. Let not the faithless, the corrupted or the demonic stand in our path, lest our divine wrath be visited upon them!

TagLoreObj_OldArkovia_History01Name=Last Days of Arkovia
TagLoreObj_OldArkovia_History01Text=As I write this, dark columns of smoke billow up from the port where the madness long pullulating in the restive populace has finally boiled over. A blazing merchant's galley, abandoned by its crew and freed of its moorings plows into a group of fishing boats, wood splintering, the fire quickly spreading among the sails. I hear shouting in the courtyard below and the clash of iron not far beyond; a woman screams repeatedly, her words indiscernible.{^n}{^n}For so long, we feared our doom would come from the barbarous mountain tribes but in the end, we've been the instruments of our own demise; helped along by the insidious promises of the necromancers.{^n}{^n}It is not yet two moons since the great rituals were undertaken, led by our ever reaching Oligarchs; the rituals intended to bring immortality and ensure the lasting greatness of Arkovia. Ever the skeptic, I figured it for a sham; political theatre at best, but the ritual seems to have been a tragic success.{^n}{^n}This ritual was the invention of a necromancer named Uroboruuk. A man imprisoned in the Steps of Torment, who it is said did not age and could not be killed by any means. The leaders of the three greatest houses, including my own patron, Laudos Vagra, made an ill-conceived journey to the tower in hopes of compelling this Uroboruuk to give up his secrets. Here, immortality worked against Uroboruuk as he was subjected to the most brutal and imaginative forms of torture that could be devised for a man who could not die. Finally, Uroboruuk agreed to instruct them in the ritual and the Oligarchs, blinded by their lust for immortality, were all too eager to believe his will broken and accepted the ritual as genuine.{^n}{^n}It has become clear that the people of Arkovia have indeed gained a form of immortality but it is a cruel and twisted fulfillment of that promise. Our bodies still suffer the ravages of time, eventually dying and decaying, whilst our spirits remain trapped within, eternally bound to this land.{^n}{^n}I have witnessed this myself as the sick and elderly, near death at the time of the ritual, remain with us yet. Their bodies visibly decay, in the manner of a corpse, yet they continue on as though living, able to move and talk; still much the same persons as they were in life, yet not.{^n}{^n}All who suffer this death of the body become somehow less vital, less dynamic of thought. They become ever more narrowly focused on whatever concerned them most in life. It is disturbing to witness families that do not know what to do with their deceased, yet still present, loved ones.{^n}{^n}More horrible still are the rumors of babies born since the ritual. Abominations they say, deformed and bearing dark grisly feathers. It is said that many forlorn new fathers have been seen trekking into the broken hills, bundle in arm, to leave their unnatural offspring to the elements.{^n}{^n}The din of fighting and wailing continues on below. I expect it shall for quite some time since the combatants cannot die by any mortal means. I will sit with my books and continue my writing for whatever time may remain... perhaps all eternity...{^n}{^n}Theodokus Vagra, Scribe of Arkovia

tagLoreObj_BookC01Name=Gildam Arcanum - Page 1
tagLoreObj_BookC01Text=To understand the flows of the Aether, one must first learn to appreciate its inherent risks. The arcane art is not a plaything, nor is it a tool meant to be abused. Countless young arcanists have lost their lives to carelessness and malpractice. Proper control of the Aether requires years of practice under the careful supervision of the Gildam Arcanum, the only formal office sanctioned to instruct and research the art of the arcane. Do not confuse what is lectured here with the teachings of the hypothetical witch gods, a common misconception amongst the uneducated. There are no gods. There is only reality and the science of the arcane.

tagLoreObj_BookC02Name=Gildam Arcanum - Page 2
tagLoreObj_BookC02Text=To reinforce the ingenuity of arcanists both living and dead, we turn to the works of Master Maiven, a prolific arcanist from the third age of our glorious empire. Master Maiven was able to bend the inherently destructive flows of the Aether to her will in order to manifest a protective barrier around herself. This technique is a stellar example of how the Gildam Arcanum continually strives to break our preconceptions of the Aether, creating entirely new schools of thought within the arcane arts.

tagLoreObj_BookD01Name=Origin of the Slith - Page 1
tagLoreObj_BookD01Text=In all the history of our great nation, there has been no greater atrocity committed than the creation of the vile vermin we call Slith. Part man, part serpent, the Slith were a testament to the dangers of the arcane and served as the driving force behind the formation of the Gildam Arcanum and its tighter sanctions on arcane practices.{^n}{^n}The Slith owe their existence to the actions of a single individual: Oswald Hargate. Backed by family wealth and a passion for research, Oswald aspired to leave his mark upon the study of the arcane. Little did he know that his legacy would leave a permanent stain upon all Arcanists and their field.

tagLoreObj_BookD02Name=Origin of the Slith - Page 2
tagLoreObj_BookD02Text=Oswald Hargate firmly believed that the Aether could be used to create new life. Convinced that he could supersede the gods, Oswald set out to perform his heinous research in a, to this day, unknown location.{^n}{^n}Though not much is known about the exact details of his research, the results were quite clear. Calling his creation a Slith, for its slithering movement and snake-like lower body, Oswald triumphantly announced his findings to the Arcanum Society. The abomination bore the torso of a man and the tail of a snake, though its reptilian snout was unlike either species. Its eyes stared back at you with a hint of human sorrow, though it was clearly a dulled mind with no indication of a human conscience trapped within the slith body.{^n}{^n}Those attending were shocked by the blatant disregard for the gods and their domain. Following a brief trial, Oswald was charged with endangering society and was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The specimen was destroyed and its ashes scattered to the winds. With Oswald behind bars and the slith dead, all believed that the nightmare was over; but they were wrong.

tagLoreObj_BookD03Name=Origin of the Slith - Page 3
tagLoreObj_BookD03Text=When the first slith began to appear in the area known as Wightmire, it became clear that Oswald did not create just one slith. As his laboratory was never uncovered, officials could only guess as to the origin of the new species. The slith were incredibly invasive, easily dominating the local food chain and reproducing at an alarming rate.{^n}{^n}As their numbers multiplied, the slith adapted a primitive tribal hierarchy, with certain members of their packs exhibiting clear authority over the rest. And, perhaps most alarmingly of all, shamanistic behavior was reported among the slith population, indicating a strong connection to the Aether and perhaps their unnatural origins.{^n}{^n}All efforts to exterminate the slith proved fruitless, with the species simply returning at a new location from hidden nests and caverns. It is without a doubt that the actions of one arrogant individual will continue to reverberate across countless generations to come.

tagLoreObj_BookD04Name=Hargate's Journal - Page 1
tagLoreObj_BookD04Text=First day at my new lab. I must say, I am thrilled to get started. The days of having my nose stuck in the books are over. There comes a time when studying old tomes reaches its limit. Eventually, one must set out on their own to pursue new ventures and ideas not yet considered. It is our sacred duty as scholars to leave a mark upon the world!{^n}{^n}My wife, Helen, and my dearest daughter Ellena will be joining me soon at our new home. Helen has expressed concern about our little girl growing up in a laboratory, so far away from other children, but I've calmed her down. Ellena will have everything she requires, and Burrwitch is just a short boat ride away should she ask for a playmate.{^n}{^n}Together, Helen and I are going to do something no Arcanist has dared even consider: the creation of new life. The Aether is a wondrous source of energy, and yet nobody's stopped to ponder its effects upon organic material. Helen's expertise in the biological arts should prove most valuable in this endeavor.

tagLoreObj_BookD05Name=Hargate's Journal - Page 2
tagLoreObj_BookD05Text=At Helen's recommendation, I have chosen the lowly green swamp adder as the basis of my experiment. Its short lifespan and rapidly shedding skin made for a malleable test subject. The initial results seemed promising at first. Using high concentrations of Aether energy, we were able to instill various mutations within the specimens, creating new limbs or inducing gigantism. Unfortunately, none of the samples survived beyond a couple weeks, their higher brain functions being seemingly incapable of handling the introduction of additional bodily elements.{^n}{^n}For our second batch of experiments, we molded the adders with a few grobles captured by local trappers. The results were...curious to say the least. While this was not the breakthrough I was looking for, we seem to be heading in the right direction. The dull mind of a groble was capable of adapting to its new body, but its primitive and disgustingly malformed physique would see me become the laughing stock of my colleagues. No, I must see this through to its logical conclusion. Helen may frown upon it, but the next step seems clear as day to me...

tagLoreObj_BookD06Text=I have sent Helen and Ellena away for the summer to visit family in the capital while I continue my work alone.

My collaborators took their pay and left promptly without asking any questions. Frankly, they looked a bit disturbed. But I was unfazed. They are but simpletons, unable to fathom the importance of my work.{^n}{^n}The specimens began stirring by morning, their frightened cries echoing throughout the lab. I explained to them that they were selected for an important duty, that their lives would finally have meaning and purpose. The scum should have been thanking me, but instead they cursed me as a madman and criminal. I dismissed their accusations and got to work. There was much to be done.

While Ellena was otherwise occupied with her toys in the living quarters, Helen came down into the lab to find me in the midst of my latest study. The horrified look on her face is something I shall never forget. I tried to be reasonable. I explained that what she witnessed was merely a stepping stone, that those men and women died so that our work would not be squandered on snakes and grobles. But she would not budge.{^n}{^n}My wife, my partner, had betrayed me at this most critical junction. My work is too important to let emotional attachments get in the way. I did the only sensible thing. Let history judge my actions...{^n}{^n} With the unfortunate distraction dealt with, I returned to my results. The human-snake hybrids had proven unstable and violent. I was assaulted on several occasions while attempting to study their physical functions, but those attacks proved to be little more than outbursts on the verge of death. All of the specimens died shortly after the procedure. Dissection revealed an incomplete hybridization of internal organs. With a dysfunctional digestive system, death was inevitable. But I wonder if perhaps the subjects were too old for the procedure to succeed. If I started over, with a younger candidate, then perhaps I would finally have the results I seek...

We are bound to our flesh and bone, even as they rot away to the winds of time.{^n}{^n}To others, a knife brings a sharp reminder that we once lived. There are those who willingly partake of this newfound pleasure, carving each other apart in a downward spiral of decadence and depravity.

Under the weight of undeniable evidence and witness reports, this court had no choice but to sentence the necromancer Olurokk to hanging until dead.{^n}{^n}This crime is but a drop in the well of the sins committed by necromancers in our land. The people have spoken and action must be taken.

tagLoreObj_Cronley_NoteA04codexTitle=Annals of Arkovia
tagLoreObj_Cronley_NoteA04Text=It falls upon strange times that a king would abdicate the throne of his own volition. Stranger still is the reason he gave his court. There is no other way to put it. King Rhowan, the third of his line, had been struck by madness. Upon returning from a successful campaign against the barbarian tribes of Agarond's Peak, the King raved about a chance meeting with a weary traveler whom he called Mogdrogen. Rhowan, in his generosity, offered the old man the use of his horse. The man, and here is where the King's tale loses all sense, declined the proposal and, speaking in a low voice that only his Majesty could hear, instead offered Rhowan a warning.{^n}{^n}The old man spurted prophetic lies about the impending collapse of our great nation and the fall of the beacon of the west, Arkovia herself. He implored the King to leave his title, his wealth, his very identity behind. There were some amongst the court who urged Rhowan to see his madness through, greedy heads of Arkovian Houses who saw this tragedy as an opportunity to seize power. The Queen, the shining jewel of Arkovia, wept before her King and begged him to reconsider; but Rhowan was resolute. With a single decree, he shattered the royal line and abandoned his ordained post as King of Arkovia. Word of the King's madness spread quickly among the populace. To my great surprise, some of his subjects followed Rhowan's lead, abandoning their livelihoods to follow their despondent ruler into a life of poverty and lost identity.{^n}{^n}It has been three fortnights since that fateful day. The queen lies dead in her chambers. They say she had died of sorrow, from the loss of her King, but I suspect more clandestine causes. The court has fallen into chaos as the great Houses bicker amongst themselves for the empty throne. With no end in sight to the squabbles and no clear line to the throne, my patron, Laudos Vagra, has called for the formation of an Oligarchy, ruled by the heads of Arkovia's elite.{^n}{^n}No good can come of this. Of that I am certain. These days, I cannot help but wonder if Rhowan's prophecy was a self-fulfilling one. Or perhaps this storm was a longtime coming and we were merely too blind to see it. I fear for Arkovia. I fear for her soul.{^n}{^n}Theodokus Vagra, Scribe of Arkovia

Only thing that'd give them away was the eyes. The eyes glowed that sickly aether-green. They offered me a chance to surrender, a chance to live out our lives as vessels and breeders for their growing army. I sent their heads back on spikes. See if those spirits survive that.{^n}{^n}But when they came back again, with new terms, well...then they were speaking my language. I was to be a piece in their grand design, a master of my very own army of aether-empowered humans.

They have no idea of what suffering and agony is in store for them. I sometimes wish that more would die during the procedure.

He cannot stop the muse that pulls the strings of my heart.{^n}{^n}The Lashing Willow, by Daila Thornsbury{^n}{^n}The limbs of the willow tree tapped a steady rhythm against the bedroom window. Another storm was building up on the horizon, but Daila could not shake the feeling that this would not be just another shower. She sat up in her bed and took a quick glance at her husband, Oliver. He was still fast asleep. Not even a hurricane would stir that man from his slumber.{^n}{^n}Daila got up, making sure not to shift the covers off her husband. She tip-toed to the wardrobe and retrieved her gear: a well-worn suit of light leather armor and her trusty sword, Stormheart. The blade sparked with electricity as she removed it from its scabbard. The enchantment was still as strong as the day she had found it in the tomb north of Sorrow's Bastion. Daila replaced the blade and hooked the scabbard into her belt. She took one last glance at Oliver before heading out the door. It was best he did not know about her little nightly vigils. He would just worry himself sick, and Daila could not stand to see him so obsessed over her safety.{^n}{^n}The wind whipped Daila's hair around her face as she stepped out the front door. The rain was already starting to pick up; the ground was drenched with moisture, turning the path into mud. Daila tread carefully, planting every step on a stone or where the ground was still firm. At last, she arrived at the edge of the weeping willow, where a deep sense of dread immediately overcame her.{^n}{^n}"I knew you'd come out to greet me, Daila my dear," a ghastly voice spoke from behind the tree. Daila drew Stormheart, its sparking surface turning the rain drops into mist. A dark figure showed itself and calmly walked towards her. She could not see the man's face, but she knew well who he was. "Come now, is that any way to greet your brother?" The man spoke again. Daila did not say a word. Instead, she let her blade do the talking for her. The figure countered her blows with a blade of his own, a burning sword that left streaks of fire across the air with every swing. "I see you've been practicing," the man said with a grin forming on his lips.{^n}{^n}Thunder crackled in the sky as lightning flared down from the heavens, briefly illuminating the scene. The light from the storm revealed the face of Daila's adversary, the grisly heavily decayed face of her dead brother. "Dravis," Daila hissed through clenched teeth. She dove in for another attack...

tagLoreObj_AreaCFarmer_NoteA01Text=I can see smoke rising from the Everbrook estate. They're nearly here, whatever they are. I've barricaded the doors and windows as best I could. All that remains now is to wait for them to come to us.{^n}{^n}The wife insisted that we abandon the farm and head for Homestead, but I'll be damned if I let some green-eyed freaks kick us off our land. Our family has not toiled on this farm for generations just to leave it at the first sign of trouble. Those cowards in Homestead can leave their crops to rot. When all this blows over, I'll still be here tending to the harvest, and they will look the fools.

tagLoreObj_AreaCFarmer_NoteA03Name=Wald's Note
tagLoreObj_AreaCFarmer_NoteA03Text=We got away! I couldn't believe it at the time, but we gave those Aetherial bastards the slip. They'll never think to look out here in the wilderness. There's nothing here but trees and rocks. Certainly nothing for the likes of them.{^n}{^n}I've gone ahead and set up camp while a few of the guys ventured out to scavenge for berries and firewood. They should be returning soon. May not be much, but I think we can turn this place into a home away from home. Hell, even the birds must be finding it to their liking. I can see a few of them circling overhead from time to time.

tagLoreObj_AreaCAetherial_NoteA01Name=The Amalgamation
tagLoreObj_AreaCAetherial_NoteA01Text=Consensus is achieved. The sanctum of Homestead is to fall within the fortnight. With the Herald making its steady approach from the north, nothing but conflagration in its wake, it falls upon me to render a force capable of assaulting the human stronghold from the west. The reanimators are tirelessly working within the cages, pouring the gift of the Aether into the humans and trolls we had gathered for the purpose. But the real work will be conducted within the barn.{^n}{^n}It is true that the humans have proven to be...difficult hosts, the mind struggles against a greater power it cannot possibly fathom. But the flesh? It is malleable, easily tainted.  I look upon the corpses filling the barn with the stench of decay not as a sign of how fragile life is, but as a canvas; a canvas upon which we will paint the future of Cairn.{^n}{^n}Theodin Marcell, Shaper of Flesh

tagLoreObj_BlackLegion_NoteA01Name=Black Legion Scouting Report
tagLoreObj_BlackLegion_NoteA01Text=I write this letter to report of extreme and disturbing Aetherial activity to the North of Homestead. I set off to the foothills and made my way through the warren of low stone walls, fences, and occasional farmhouses. I was careful to move in secret and remain undetected from the horrors that still roam the fields unchecked. I made it to the valley of two hills near the river when I witnessed something I can barely comprehend. {^n}{^n}An unearthly black pillar that was neither stone nor flesh drifting slowly across the land as would a low cloud.  A sickly green glow burned at its core and great writhing tendrils hung from somewhere underneath the shifting back shell. I watched in mounting dread as the unholy obelisk slowed and then, without warning, burrowed the hooks of the dangling tentacles into the ground. The ground began to wither and glow with the same unwholesome green. It was then that the obelisk pulled itself into the ground. With a sound that made me feel as if the earth was dying, it began glowing so bright I could hardly look. Its power seeped into the ground, twisting and corrupting as it spread. {^n}{^n}I lingered for nearly an hour in that place and in that time a great distance around the obelisk had been changed. I was about to leave when the obelisk erupted from the ground and drifted to an untouched patch of land to begin the cycle again. We must act soon or there will be nothing left to save. {^n}{^n}--6th Regimental Scouts of the Black Legion, Renall Oberach

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA01Name=Avalline's Note - Page 1
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA01Text=We've been on the run for what feels like weeks now. The Aetherials are always on our heels, spreading like wildfire across the countryside. The children are starving; the few bites of food we manage to scavenge on the go aren't enough for all four of us. I'm not sure how much more of this we can take.{^n}{^n}Word on the road is that the Cult of Ch'thon is accepting members, that they have food and shelter for all. I've always pictured them as heretical lunatics, howling at the moon as they bathe in blood, but the promises of safety may be too much to pass on. Thallon cringes at the thought of being seen among the Bloodsworn, but we agree that it may be a necessary evil in order to survive. Our children deserve to eat.

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA02Name=Avalline's Note - Page 2
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA02Text=Life among the Bloodsworn has required some changes to our little family, mainly that we can only see the children after the day's rituals and chores are finished, which usually last late into the evening. Some days I don't see them at all until they are already asleep. My husband is having a difficult time with the prayers, he calls them blasphemous filth, but I remind him that we are doing this for our family's survival.{^n}{^n}Myself, I cannot help but question the gods who have given us nothing except poverty. But here, under the protection of Ch'thon, we are safe and fed. The Bloodsworn have given us everything they had promised, and more. All they ask in return is our devotion and a little bit of blood.{^n}{^n}So I can't help myself when I chant a little louder each morning as I sing my praises to Ch'thon. The cuts from the ritual knife serve as a gentle reminder that we are still alive and not rotting out in the wilderness. It feels...good. By Ch'thon, it feels good...

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA03Text=All begins and ends with Ch'thon. I can see that now. My family's suffering, the poverty we've endured? These are all symptoms of our separation from Ch'thon. The Bloodsworn have shown me the way to salvation.{^n}{^n}I have prayed long and hard at the altar, poured my lifeblood out onto the stones until the answers came to me. The only way my family can truly be safe is to be reunited with Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}I have made the necessary arrangements. The sacrifice will proceed at dawn.

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA04Name=Blood for Ch'thon
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA04Text=I try to console them. I tell them everything will be alright. Their eyes go wide with fear as I find the spot between the ribs and push the blade in. They always cry and it makes me a little sad. They do not yet understand. I watch the blood as it flows down their naked legs and into the large basin I have placed below their suspended form. Ch'thon calls for every drop.{^n}{^n}To ensure I get it all, I begin by making shallow cuts. First the legs. Then the torso. And lastly the arms. Slowly their struggle rescinds and they accept their fate. At last they find understanding.{^n}{^n}The blood is not theirs. They are only holding it for another. And now it must be returned. To Ch'thon, whom it rightly belongs. At last their fear is peeled away and they are happy to give the blood freely.{^n}{^n}Devoted Servant of Ch'Thon, Bellor Heind

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA05Name=The Call of Blood
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA05Text=My whole life I have reveled in the spilling of blood. For years I have been driven to hunt in the shadows. Lurking and hunting alone. But I am alone no longer. At long last I have found what has called to me.{^n}{^n}Ch'thon has whispered to me and the Grim Dawn has released my shackles. Now I take my pleasure and collect the blood for my Lord. It fills my heart and warms my soul to watch the last drops of blood flow.{^n}{^n}The old world was not understanding of my need. But now a new power has risen and Ch'thon has called on me. And those who do answer the Call will be my prey.

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultistSummoner_NoteName=Final Sermon: The End of Times
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultistSummoner_CodexTitle=The End of Times
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultistSummoner_NoteText=Bloodsworn supplicants of Ch'thon, it is with great purpose that we gather here today for what will be my final sermon to you. You have devoted yourselves completely, forsaking all past relations, earthly possessions and free will. You have proven that you are finally ready to become part of a greater whole, to receive the glorious gift of reunification.{^n}{^n}I must remain behind with the others to finish our great work, yet, even as you depart your lives, you will advance this broken world one step closer to the end time. The time when the dismal, suffering world will become reunited with Ch'thon, making the oldest of the old whole again and righting the great wrong perpetrated millennia ago by the false gods! These upstart gods who manipulated the course of our existence, set themselves up to be the objects of worship and have lived off our blood and toil for ages.{^n}{^n}The end time will also bring doom to the wayward Aetherials, past agents of the false gods who were betrayed and then cast into the formless aether once their purpose had been served. They have hindered us, slaughtered our brethren and tried to claim dominance over this world. Yet, we must also thank them, for it is the Aetherials who have unwittingly made possible our ascension by destroying the empire and its inquisition. No longer does the inquisition hunt us, suppress our truths or deny us access to our sacred places. Unshackled from the strictures of the empire, people have awakened from the false dream of civilization and our ranks have swelled.{^n}{^n}Not knowing the history of our world, the Aetherials are ignorant of the doom that we will awaken. They cannot surmise our end game and once they realize what they have set in motion, it will be too late for them to stop us! Our most devoted brethren march with legions of the void for Necropolis. They need only prevent our enemies from breaching our final line for even as they attack our forces, the blood they spill will feed our resurrection ritual. Where once we suffered our greatest defeat, our ultimate triumph shall be reborn and the Loghorrean, forerunner of the end time, will carry the thousand screaming voices of Ch'thon into world and usher in a new age!

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note01Name=Laruka's Journal
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note01Text=Today marks a critical moment in my life as one of Uroboruuk's pupils. Having passed the trials, the only thing that stands between me and the coveted title of necromancer is performing a reanimation.{^n}{^n}I've had the pleasure of seeing our master at work countless times. He is truly a master of the craft, requiring neither reagent nor word to bring the dead back into the living. Uroboruuk claims that this is a matter of practice and form, but I am convinced otherwise. His grasp over death supersedes us all, even his oldest students who, at a whim, may call upon spirits to do their bidding; but even they require binding runes and focusing stones of which our master makes no use of. The dead Uroboruuk brings back don't just serve him; they seem eager to please their master, as if to earn his favor.{^n}{^n}But now it is my turn to join the elite ranks of the Order. I've studied the scrolls, learned the rites and burned the words into my memory through exhaustive repetition. I've gathered the grave moss and the dust from buried bones. I am ready. Tomorrow, I will drag a soul back from beyond the veil of death and force it into skeletal remains. Tomorrow I emerge from the sepulcher as a full-fledged necromancer.

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note02Name=Order Doctrine
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note02Text=The Order of Death's Vigil was founded upon the principles of Uroboruuk, our immortal grandmaster. Uroboruuk taught us to never be fulfilled by life's countless mysteries, to reach ever deeper into the fount of knowledge.{^n}{^n}As members of the Order, it is our sacred duty to preserve and maintain knowledge, regardless of its origins or unsettling nature; as it is not for man to discern its value. Knowledge is a wealth easily squandered by those who fear it, as evidenced by the near eradication of our Order's founding doctrine, the art of necromancy.{^n}{^n}Mastery of the ultimate fate which awaits all men represents an unparalleled frontier of learning. So it falls upon our neophytes to conquer their fear of death, to accept its harsh lessons. For not even in death does duty end. 

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note03Name=Uroboruuk's Journal - Page 1
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note03Text=Something powerful is coming from beyond. I have sensed its approach for some time now. But like a dream or some distant memory, the details were lost to me... until now.{^n}{^n}I can feel it clawing its way through the veil somewhere to the east of Burrwitch, no doubt drawn here by the maelstrom of otherworldly corruption. I dare say, its nature eludes even me; but it is neither flesh nor spirit. I must discover what it is we are facing and, should the need arise, seal it away again behind the barrier between worlds.{^n}{^n}The Order need not concern itself with these matters quite yet. I must do this alone...{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note04Name=Uroboruuk's Journal - Page 2
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note04Text=I will rip the bones from a thousand for this treachery. At a great cost I have survived a deadly attack.{^n}{^n}I had discovered a large contingent of Chthonic fiends. At first, I thought they were the source of power that I sought and so I followed them. As they travelled East, I soon realized that they too were after the same thing as I. They made their way to the cliffs by way of the swamp. In following them, I had walked right into an ambush as I was suddenly attacked from behind.{^n}{^n}The fight was devastating and I destroyed dozens in the ensuing conflict. However, in the midst of battle, several of the Harbingers cornered my Guardian. I first believed they intended to destroy it; but when they exploded, a rush of Chthonic energy surged into my creation and severed our link. The animated mass of bone turned on me, and I knew then that the Harbingers had found a way to corrupt my necromantic creation. I do not understand how they were capable of doing this but it was unlike anything I have ever seen Chthonic beings do.{^n}{^n}If the fiends of the Void are able to harness this power on a larger scale, then the Order of Death's Vigil will find itself outmatched. I must maintain hope that what I seek will be an answer to fighting this darkness. With each step the power grows and others will be drawn to it. I must hurry.{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note01Name=Acolyte's Pledge
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note01Text=When the world ended, I did not know how I would survive. It was only by the grace of Kymon that they found me. Burried in the mud and rubble of my house, it was Father Kymon who knew where to find me. It was his hands that pulled me free of certain death.{^n}{^n}Now that I am here, I pledge to do everything I can to fight this evil and to serve the cause that gave me a second chance. It is by the will of Kymon that I now carry his light to the world and save who I can. Praise be to the Blessed Father.{^n}{^n}Acolyte of the Chosen, Carth Lavine

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note02Name=Beacon of Hope
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note02Text=I have seen first-hand the cleansing power of the flame of Kymon and will never falter in my belief. Our forces outnumbered by horrors beyond comprehension, it was then that I first laid eyes upon him.{^n}{^n}Like a shining beacon in the chaos, Father Kymon charged into battle. He was as a flaming wind scorching a forest left to grow wild for too long, cutting down the twisted and reviled roots that seek to strangle this world of light. I knew that day that he will be the one to lead us from this horror. It is his righteousness that burns through the darkness of this world and banishes the evil. I will not fail him.{^n}{^n}Blade Maiden Sendra Ambri

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note03Name=Kymon's Journal - Page 1
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note03Text=The Messenger is harsh to deal with. With each exchange I feel drained as though my life were being drawn into a deep well. Everything appears darker and father away as if seen though a long tunnel. A lesser man without the years of Inquisitor mental training would be consumed.{^n}{^n}Even as I write this, I can sense its energy rippling through the room. I can feel it like worms twitching below my skin. It burrows and pulls, urging me to get closer. I dread to think of what would become of any of my Chosen should they get too close to this entity. What would remain, I cannot say, but I suspect the Messenger would shuck the mind and claim the body for its own.{^n}{^n}I fear there are none who would understand or survive this secret. I alone must shoulder this burden and so I will steel myself and endure. I have taken on a great risk, but the fate of the world hinges on the success of The Chosen and the pact that I have made.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note04Name=Kymon's Journal - Page 2
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note04Text=There are questions that have been scratching at the back of my mind. I have tried to push them aside but with each conversation I have with the Messenger they become harder to ignore.{^n}{^n}I must ask: when the last demon is driven from this world, what will become of us then? In my heart, I fear I already know the answer, but dare not speak it out loud. I have no doubt that I have made the right choice. The power I have revived will be humanity's salvation from the blood fiends of the Chthonic Void.{^n}{^n}However, there must always be evil. And when there is no evil left to conquer who or, more frighteningly, what will fill that emptiness? Will we become as reviled as those who we oppose? The Primordial powers have no care or sympathy for humanity. Without shackles, this power I have borrowed could be just as disastrous as, or perhaps even worse than, Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}I now wish I had not burned the town where I awoke this ancient being. If it ever needs to be stopped I may have destroyed the last remaining knowledge to unmake it.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon
