Bounty: Ballior
Bounty
Ballior was once a joyful older man who managed a bakery in Burrwitch. Sadly, he fell when the Aetherials attacked.{^n}{^n}I dread to think of what the Aetherials had done to his remains when they dragged him into a cellar. It would ease my heart to know that he is at peace.{^n}{^n}I do not have much to offer, but I've set aside some materials for anyone that puts Ballior to rest.

巴里奥是个有趣的老人家，以前在伯威治镇经营一家烘培坊。当虚灵来袭时，他不幸亡故。{^n}{^n} 当他被怪物拖进下水道以后，我都不敢想象那些怪物会对他的残躯做些什么。而如果他能安息，我的心里会好受许多。{^n}{^n} 如果有人能让巴里奥安息，尽管手里不宽裕，我还是拨出了一些材料以做奖赏。
