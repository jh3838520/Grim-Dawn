The Search for Food
We Need Food
Speak to Barnabas
With the Cronley and his gang dealt with, Captain Bourbon feels it is imperative to deal with the prison's dwindling food supplies. Mornay instructed you to speak to Barnabas about a potential solution to the problem.

Go through Smuggler's Pass
With the bridge connecting to the Arkovian Foothills repaired, you must now carve your way through the wilderness to rediscover a way to the once thriving farming community that supplied the Burrwitch region with its harvests. Start by following the road out into the Arkovian Foothills, all the way through Old Arkovia. If the bridge near Twin Falls still stands, you can cross it to enter the farmlands, otherwise you may have to find another path. Barnabas mentioned an old smuggling route that ran through the Broken Hills. If you cannot traverse the bridge, you should look for Smuggler's Pass instead.
